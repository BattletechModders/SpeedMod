BattleTech already has a feature to enable faster gameplay, but that was only available through the debug menu. With this mod you now can easily make the game work faster or even slower.

Setting | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
speedFactor | float | 5 | 1 = normal speed, set this higher or lower to make the speed mod faster or slower.
